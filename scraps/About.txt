"scraps" is a place where I shall think in the form of code, assembling small, 
functional, arbitrary C++ source code.

It will do little things and I shall hopefully begin assembling little things 
out of them, but nothing usable will exist for a long time.

I'm just making things that can be pulled into an actual program in the future.
