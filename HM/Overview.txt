Harvest Moon is a beautiful game series, completely lovely.

It is a game about farming, and socialising with town members, and growing your 
infrastructure in a very manual, hands-on way.

In terms of social hierarchy, the game features the town with its management, 
the economy, which is a combination of import goods and export farming, and all 
of the services necessary for running and growing a farm.
