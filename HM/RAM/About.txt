Running Harvest Moon DS on the Desmume DS emulator, I have recently taken to 
assembling my own cheats for the game, using data freezing methods;

I plan on learning action replay properly (I read through a document once but 
never actually played with anything)
but for now, I'm just collecting memory references that will be useful should I 
want to make cheats later; for the time being the memory adresses are still very 
useful, as Desmume allows you to open up the games simulated memory, and manually 
change values, (Tools -> View memory)
meaning that I can by hand fabricate objects in my inventory, I also started to 
learn manually editing the terrain, but it isn't useful enough to be worth 
collecting the values for different tile types just yet, especially since it is 
so much easier to give yourself a billion dollars.

Anyways, the work I am doing is being documented in several text files, and so I 
want to start uploading them to GitHub, I don't want to lose all of this already 
wasted time.

The work can be seen in this directory as a result.

NOTE
	The file containing actual action replay codes doesn't contain all of the 
	things I am using in game (I'm not using any codes retrieved online, I 	just have a number of memory adresses that are useful to have recorded 	should I want to freeze them)
	I only recently started the actual production of codes, and as of the 
	time this about.txt is being written, the one action replay code is the 
	only useful action replay I even have.

		near the mines.
